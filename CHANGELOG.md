## [Unreleased] — production hardening

### Added
- Four new `voice_tradition` variants (32 total) for vocal lineages the palette
  lacked: `sami_joik_tradition` (Nordic Sápmi joik), `andean_quechua_tradition`
  (Quechua/Aymara wayno), `native_american_vocal_tradition` (Plains/Southwest
  powwow & ceremonial), `southeast_asian_folk_vocal_tradition` (lam/mor-lam,
  luk-thung). 20 traditions reassigned off the `modern_pop_vocal_training`
  default onto these. Variant descriptor tokens were tuned to distinctive
  proper-noun stems so the engine's scorer surfaces them only for their own
  region (Sámi/Andean/SE-Asian/Lakota traditions auto-select correctly; spurious
  cross-genre bleed eliminated — verified by sweeping the scorer over all 1090).
- `scripts/audit_coherence.js` (`npm run audit:coherence`): a substantive
  **coherence** auditor that complements `validate` (reference resolution) and
  `audit` (token/descriptor health) by checking that a tradition's fields are
  mutually consistent — the class of issue that passes every structural gate
  because a generic default was stamped early and never customized. Checks:
  archetype↔explicit-medium recording-era clash, voice-multitrack-stack era vs
  medium, stamped `voice_tradition: modern_pop_vocal_training` on traditional
  forms (with palette suggestions), precise non-12-TET tuning contradictions
  (pentatonic/modal correctly excluded), plus advisory environment-collapse and
  single-instrument reports. `--json` / `--full` / `--section=` / `--strict`.
- `scripts/_apply_trad_edits.js`: surgical, id-scoped field editor for
  `05_traditions.js` (one tradition per line). Asserts the prior value and a
  unique, delimiter-anchored match before writing, so an edit can never corrupt
  a neighbouring field (e.g. top-level `tuning` vs the `string_tuning` part).
- `scripts/check_doc_behaviors.js` (folded into `npm run check-docs`, so it runs in
  CI): a third doc gate that asserts the documented *behaviors and outputs* of the
  agent-facing docs, not merely that commands exit 0. `check_docs.js` gates the catalog
  counts and `check_doc_commands.js` gates that every documented command runs — neither
  caught SKILL.md §3f drifting, which kept warning (as "verified") that a bare
  `--diff <a> <b>` "dies" long after `recipe.js`'s `BOOLEAN_FLAGS` made every argument
  ordering work. Each assertion pins one documented behavior to the SKILL.md section that
  states it — the `--diff` arg-order/byte-identity contract, `--swap-variant` exit-2
  rejection, stapling order → lead tradition, the `nearest_neighbor` / `preface_configure`
  outputs cited as "Verified", and arrangement being CLI-only — and fails CI when reality
  diverges (proven against the historical `--diff` regression).
- **Voice model expanded with two new articulatory dimensions + an `auto: false`
  explicit-only variant mechanism.** The `voice` instrument gains `voice_vocal_tract`
  (tongue-root / vowel posture: `tongue_root_retracted_dark`, `tongue_root_advanced_bright`,
  `pharyngeal_widened_yawned`, `nasalized_tract`) and `voice_effort` (phonatory effort /
  subglottal pressure: `effort_minimal_undersung`, `effort_projected`, `effort_pressed_maximal`),
  plus a `slow_wide_terminal_vibrato` vibrato variant and an `appalachian_outlaw_folk_tradition`
  vocal tradition. These give native slots to vocal techniques the model previously had to
  cram into `voice_quality` — e.g. "keep subglottal pressure minimal / sing at conversation
  volume or below" (effort) and "pull the tongue root back, target back vowels" (vocal tract),
  which can now coexist with a lowered larynx and fry instead of competing for one slot. To add
  them without perturbing a single existing recipe, every new non-default variant carries
  `auto: false`: `search.js` skips such variants in BOTH the seed pick (`seedFromTradition`) and
  the hill-climb (`variantSwapMoves`), so an optional dimension stays at its neutral
  (empty-descriptor, silently-dropped) default for every tradition unless a caller selects it
  explicitly via `--swap-variant` (which pins it past the search). Verified zero-blast — recipes
  1198/1198, prefaces 79/79, app 56/56, equivalence 8/8, all byte-identical.
- `voice_mechanism_compound` gains `voice_mechanism_supraglottal_rasp_pitch_stable` — a
  controlled supraglottal rasp that rides on a clean core without bending pitch
  (`supraglottal-rasp-clean-core, pitch-stable-distortion, controlled-ventricular-overlay,
  throat-clear-grain`). Every prior supraglottal-grit option baked pitch alteration into its
  descriptors (`subharmonic` / `octave-down-pitched` / `sub-fundamental-buzz` / `screamed`),
  so a deliberate pitch-decoupled growl had no native variant. `auto: false` (explicit-only),
  so zero recipe drift.

### Changed
- Tradition defaults refined (61 traditions; recipe outputs re-snapshotted, all
  regression/equivalence gates green, `codex.html` rebuilt):
  - **Recording-era coherence (21):** corrected anachronistic `chain_archetype`
    labels and the explicit medium/voice-multitrack stamps that contradicted
    them — e.g. modern digital genres (reggaeton, merengue urbano, bachata,
    cumbia electrónica, sertanejo universitário, reggae fusion) no longer carry
    1950s Kingston/Havana tape archetypes; vintage forms (Lebanese tarab-pop,
    Sahel praise) no longer carry a modern-DAW archetype over a researched tube
    chain; Minneapolis synth-funk moved off a 2010s Melodyne stack.
  - **Vocal-tradition defaults (43):** replaced the catalog default
    `modern_pop_vocal_training` with the accurate vocal lineage on clearly
    traditional forms — Sardinian/Corsican/Balkan polyphony → Mediterranean
    demotic, Irish/Breton lament → sean-nós, Scottish/Hebridean → Gaelic,
    Japanese/Korean folk → min'yō/minsogak, Maghrebi/Levantine art-song → maqām,
    Yoruba dirge → Yoruba tonal, sacred-steel/prison-song → gospel. Heritage-named
    but modern-pop-sung genres (baroque pop, mandopop, Greek rock) were left as-is.

- Project scaffold: `package.json` (declared dev dependencies, `npm run` command
  surface, `engines.node >= 22`), committed lockfile, ESLint flat config, Prettier,
  `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `README.md`, this changelog, and `LICENSE`.
- `src/app.js` and `src/index.template.html`: the browser application is now
  first-class, lintable source. The build assembles `codex.html` by injecting the
  data block, the family-parts merge, and the app into a single `<!--@CODEX_BODY-->`
  marker.
- `scripts/_merge.js`: one source for the instrument family-parts merge, shared by
  the Node loader and the build (it had been written twice).
- `scripts/app_recipe_regression.js` + `tests/app_recipe_snapshot.json`: snapshot
  regression for the browser recipe path (`makeCard` → `compileStack` /
  `compileRecipeStack` across all four formats), wired into `npm test` and the build.
- `build_html --check` now asserts a hard per-`<script>` byte ceiling in addition to
  parsing the embedded data; documented exit codes.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint, validate, audit, regressions, build (with byte
  check), and UI reachability on every push and pull request.

### Changed
- `tests/ui_capability_inventory.md` (relocated from `docs/`): it is reachability-test
  input, not documentation.
- `check_docs.js` scoped to the canonical manifest (`SKILL.md`); prose docs and test
  fixtures are excluded.
- Splitter budgeting renamed `maxChars` (it measures characters); the real byte limit
  is enforced by the `--check` assertion.
- `ui_reachability_check.js` uses Playwright's bundled Chromium — removed the hardcoded
  browser path and the absolute `require`.

### Removed
- About 45 dead or vestigial files (~830 KB): `scripts/_one_off/`, orphaned scripts,
  archived audit outputs, and the entire `docs/` tree.
- The `--extract` template-reconstruction bootstrap from `build_html.js`; templates are
  required source.
- Dead code: a duplicate object key, several unused locals and parameters, and a dead
  token-set chain in `build_variants.js`. `npm run lint` is clean.

### Fixed
- Two false-positive `tandem` gates (flagging source untouched by data work):
  the card-descriptor-semantics gate now strips comments before scanning the
  HTML embed for `match_tokens` (the injected `harvestDescriptors` core carries
  a "NOT match_tokens" comment); and the inline-SVG gate now allowlists
  `glyphSvg()`, the tradition glyph/emoji renderer (a hand-rolled SVG renderer
  like the already-allowlisted viz functions, not an `icon()` bypass).
- Delete-workspace used native `confirm()` (which browsers can suppress in the embed) —
  it now uses the app's `confirmDialog`.
- `saveWS` and `delWS` now guard `window.storage` symmetrically (each early-returns on
  `!window.storage`; reads go through `safeGet`'s try/catch wrapper).
- `scripts/expand.js` truncated piped JSON at the OS pipe buffer (~64 KiB): each success
  path did `console.log(bigJSON); process.exit(0)`, and `process.exit()` tears the process
  down before a large async stdout write drains to a pipe — so `expand.js --tradition
  <id> | jq` lost everything past byte 65524 while still exiting 0 (a file redirect was
  unaffected). Success paths now set `process.exitCode` and let the event loop flush
  stdout; the flag dispatch is an `if/else-if/else` chain so they no longer fall through
  into the usage error. Exit codes unchanged (0 success / 2 error).
- Corrected two stale SKILL.md dogfooding notes the code had outrun: §3f no longer claims
  a bare `--diff <a> <b>` "dies" (every argument ordering is byte-identical, now gated by
  `check_doc_behaviors.js`), and §3h no longer says jsdom is "already installed" — the
  headless rich-recipe path needs `npm ci` first, and a fresh clone fails with "Cannot
  find module 'jsdom'" even from the repo root.

## [1.0.0]

- First fully-verified cut: 1,090 traditions, 421 instruments, 256 rooms, 22 chain
  archetypes, 21 production aesthetics. Reference integrity clean, recipe and preface
  regression green, single-file `codex.html` reproducible from source.
